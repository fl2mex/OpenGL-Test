# OpenGL Test
Just a test teaching myself how to use Modern OpenGL.<br>
I Have followed the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorial series.<br>
I'm using Survival Guitar Backpack by Berk Gedik for testing models. His work can be found [here.](http://www.berkgedik.com/)<br>
The file can be found [here.](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/survival-guitar-backpack-low-poly-799f8c4511f84fab8c3f12887f7e6b36)<br>

# Prerequisites
You need to download [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/), [GLFW (Windows Binaries)](https://www.glfw.org/download.html), and [ASSIMP](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) and put in the Dependencies folder.<br>
ASSIMP also needs to be compiled and put in the OpenGL Test folder, and kept with built binaries.

# Building
You can build this on Windows using the included Visual Studio 2022 solution.<br>
If you do not wish to build the binaries, the release builds are available to download [here.](https://github.com/fl2mex/OpenGL-Test/releases/latest)
